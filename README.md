# 31/8/24 Update:
Not getting desired resolution / differentiation from Neurosity Crown, probably hardware limitations. To resume project with EMOTIV EPOC once it gets delivered


Stage 1: Using the Neurosity Crown EEG headset to discriminate between left and right hand motor imagery. ML classification model trained using on-screen prompts

Stage 2: Using this framework to create a real-time asynchronous BCI to control basic screen commands and eventually a videogame
